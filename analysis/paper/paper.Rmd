# Introduction {-}

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a valuable source of publicly available ecological data across the United States [@keller2008continental].

We have extracted all NEON AOP hyperspectral data for every mapped stem in NEON plots where field data and airborne remote sensing data were collected during the same year.

Here's the code to extract the spectra: [https://gist.github.com/mbjoseph/5c18781e508460e14f64193571b98b7d](https://gist.github.com/mbjoseph/5c18781e508460e14f64193571b98b7d) 

We used a machine learning approach to evaluate plant identification potential using the hyperspectral data at multiple taxonomic resolutions: species and genus levels. 

Species classification is an active research area [@scholl2020integrating].

## Data cleaning {-}

## Species classification {-}

## Genus classification {-}

Same setup as species classification, but used the genus as each class label. 

# Results {-}

<!-- Here's some example analysis code: -->

```{r get-data, eval = FALSE}
# Note the path that we need to use to access our data files when rendering this document
my_data <- read.csv(here::here('analysis/data/raw_data/my_csv_file.csv'))
```

```{r demo-plot, fig.cap="A plot of random numbers"}
plot(rnorm(10))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:demo-plot) shows how we can have a caption and cross-reference for a plot

```{r demo-inline-code}
x <- round(pi, 2)
```

Here is an example of inline code `r x` in the middle of a sentence.
